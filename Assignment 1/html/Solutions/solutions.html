                    <ol>
                    <br>
                        <li>Integrated planning and programme's ie. the linking of drug abuse counselling, to anger management, entrepreneurship 
                        and skills training at the community level may all aid with the prevention, or, solution to youth violence.
                        </li>
                        <br>

                        <li>Police-Youth relations ie. Police outreach in schools especially Secondary Schools are likely to provide a 
                        good foundation for social violence prevention.
                        </li>
                        <br>

                        <li>Another point we can take into consideration, is setting up counselling for youngsters with home abuse, or who are
                        exposed to domestic violence daily. (Stable families, lead to positive behaviour and mannerisms)
                        </li>
                        <br>

                        <li>The main solution, or rather, the solution that may prove to have the best results is youth participation
                        in clubs ie. positive clubs and peer groups such as sports and any extra cirricular activity.
                        </li>

                <p>The many problems faced can be solved in different ways, the following table is a little summery of ways in which it can be solved, and the disadvantage of that solution. Your input to new possible solutions would be greatly accepted in helping to reduce to rate of crime in the Caribbean.
